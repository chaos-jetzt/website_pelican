The next chaos.jetzt geekend **#jetzt11** is just around the corner! From **November 7 to November 9, 2025**, we will meet in Frankfurt to enjoy a weekend full of exchange, ideas, and community spirit. After our gathering at Stratum 0, this time we want to strengthen the networks at the [FFM](https://ccc-ffm.de/) hub.
## What can you expect?




Dive into an interactive weekend! You bring the topics, we give you the space: workshops, talks, shared meals, and discussions about technology and (internet) policy. In addition to the program, the focus is on making connections, building networks, and forming alliances. We'll start with program planning on Friday, followed by two days full of input and exchange.
We will provide you with a quiet room and counselors.




## I want to attend!
